                    <h3>Interview with <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/profile/MKaelin368/">KWC</a> (Creator of Memory Card Game) </h3>
                    <p> ME:<p> Ok. Firstly, When did you start programming? <p>
<p>How did you learn programming?<p>
<p>What is your best advice to a beginner?<p>
<p>Are you a good card player in real life?<p>
<p>and What is your next project (you dont have to answer this) and when will it be released?<p> 
<p>Thanks :D   <P>                                                              <p>  KWC:   Sure. I will answer a few. :-)
<p>1: I started programming in early 2015 but had tried to teach myself Python through trial and error the previous year. <p>

<p>2: Though reading endless forums and documentation and through many hours of experimenting.<p>

<p>3: Don't get overwhelmed. Programming is not easy but can simplified if broken into small parts.
Now being bilingual in scripting languages I can say that if you learn one language you can easily learn another.
Starting out I think learning JS as your first language is the best way into the somewhat intimidating world of coding.
It's much more forgiving than other languages like C++ or Python.
Also that even you may have no interest in learning to build webpages, learning HTML is very important to learn about patterns that also apply to scripting.<p>

<p>4: With card games from the SET company I'm pretty good but maybe more average with regular card games.<p>

<p>5: I don't think I will have a next project for awhile. I mainly returned to KA to release Memory.

                    <p> Me : So how long have you been a programmer on KA? <p>

   <p> His Love : Ok. That's a tricky question, because technically I started learning 4 years ago, but I didn't write any code whatsoever for 3 years, until 9 months ago, when I started programming again, with better stuff.<p>

 <p>Me : Interesting. Do you program any outside of KA?<p>
 
<p>His Love: Yes, I program on TreeHouse some, and I have been working on a Discord bot and a Unity game too. But mostly just KA.<p>

<p>Me : Do you want to disclose any of your upcoming projects on KA? Its OK if you don't. <p>

<p>His Love: Well, people already know about my game, Geosketch that should be coming out in the near future, but I also am creating an epic game for the code off with SS. IT will be my best game by far. So watch out!<p>

<p>Me : Ok thanks for your time.<p>

<p> His Love :Cool! Thanks!  </p>

                    <p><p>Me : Ok. Firstly, When did you start programming?<p>
<p>How did you learn programming?<p>
<p>What is your best advice to a beginner?<p>

<p>and What is your next project (you dont have to answer this) and when will it be released? <p>
<p>Thanks :D</p>
<p>Toby : My answers: <p>

<p>1. About 9 months ago.<p>

<p>2. I originally discovered it in Khan Academy. I got interested. I'm now on the Advanced JS courses.<p>

<p>3. "Never give up. Good things will come your way." "Don't be afraid to ask questions."<p>


<p>5. I don't really know what "released" means in this case, but I'm working on a few games: "Mr. Fire," "Hopper World," and "Fruit Hut." Mr. Fire is likely to be finished the soonest, maybe this or next month.<p>

<p> Any questions?

<p>  Me : Who inspires you the most? <p>
<p> Toby: Hmm. I wouldn't say just one person inspires me the most. Lots of programmers inspire me! <p>
<P> Me : Ok. Thanks for your time. <p>

                    <h3>Interview with BB-8!</h3>
                    <p>Me :Ok. Firstly, When did you start programming?<p>

<p>How did you learn programming?<p>

<p>What is your best advice to a beginner?<p>

<p>and What is your next project (you dont have to answer this) and when will it be released?<p>

<P>Thanks :D (Im using the same questions)</p>
<p>BB-8 : - I have no idea when I started programming, but probably around 2013 or earlier. I've been programming on Khan Academy for 11 months.<p>

<p>- One of my siblings taught me programming in python. Ever since, I've been making games in python.<p>

<p>- Constantly learn new things! There are practically endless things to learn in programming! Although you might forget some things along the way (like me), the cool thing is that you're be able to relearn what you have forgotten way easier. Try learning a new programming language like Java, Python, C++, HTML/CSS, or SQL once you've become familiar with JavaScript.<p>

<p>- I just released a game, and it looks like I'll be working on a mars colonization game next. It'll be released April 1st.<p>
<p> Me: thank you. <p>
